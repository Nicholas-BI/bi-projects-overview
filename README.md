# Nicholas. – Power BI Portfolio

Welcome to my Power BI portfolio. I’m a manufacturing analyst and report designer with over 13 years of real-world production experience—and a drive to turn raw data into meaningful action.

These projects demonstrate how I build flexible, high-performance BI solutions: from strategic forecasting to KPI tracking to creative scoring engines. Each one was designed, developed, and documented by me using Power BI, DAX, and Power Query.
