# Power BI Portfolio – Nicholas

With 13+ years in manufacturing and certifications in Lean, Six Sigma (Green Belt), PL-300, and DP-900, I bring a strong foundation in both process improvement and modern data tools. I don’t just build dashboards—I know what to measure, why it matters, and how to drive real improvement.

This page serves as a portfolio overview. Some projects are temporarily private due to sensitive origins but can be made available upon request.
