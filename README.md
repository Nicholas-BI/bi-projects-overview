# Power BI Portfolio – Nicholas

With 13+ years in manufacturing and certifications in Lean and Six Sigma (Green Belt), I bring both a wide-angle view of operations and a sharp eye for process improvement. That background gives me more than just data—it gives me context. I know what metrics matter, how processes break, and where analytics can actually move the needle. The result: Power BI solutions that aren’t just clean and fast—they’re grounded, practical, and built for action.

Below are selected projects that show how I combine domain knowledge with technical depth—whether optimizing a shop floor or ranking recipes in a mobile game.
