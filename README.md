# Nicholas’s Power BI Portfolio  
**Driving measurable improvements by combining 13 years of manufacturing expertise with modern analytics**

As a Six Sigma Green Belt and certified PL-300 (Power BI Data Analyst) and DP-900 (Azure Data Fundamentals) practitioner, I build more than dashboards—I translate data into actionable insights that reduce waste, optimize throughput, and drive real improvement.

**Note:** Projects labeled **Private – Demo on Request** are available upon request.
