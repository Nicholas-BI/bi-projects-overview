# Power BI Portfolio – Nicholas

With 13+ years in manufacturing and certifications in Lean and Six Sigma (Green Belt), I pair process insight with data fluency. I don’t just build dashboards—I know what to measure, why it matters, and how to drive improvement. My reports are fast, focused, and grounded in real operational context.

Below are selected projects that show how I combine domain knowledge with technical depth—whether optimizing a shop floor or ranking recipes in a mobile game.
