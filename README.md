# Power BI Portfolio – Nicholas

I'm a certified Lean Practitioner and Six Sigma Green Belt with 13+ years in manufacturing. I build fast, clean Power BI solutions that turn raw data into decision-ready dashboards. Below are selected projects that show how I combine domain knowledge with technical depth—whether optimizing a shop floor or ranking recipes in a mobile game.
